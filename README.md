# Azure Cloud - Hub & Spoke deployment

This code deploys a HUB & Spoke diagram on Azure Cloud. For testing purposes, you can deploy the base foundation (1) and pick-up the modules you want to deploy. For instance, you can deploy the "base" and virtual-machines (4) to simulate spoke-to-spoke flows. If you want to simulate flows to/from On-Premises, the VPN components (2 and 3) are required.

## Installation

Terraform and Git (considering option 1 below) are required.

## Usage

You can 1) clone this repo or 2) download the individual files (respecting the directory structure). Up to you which options better fits your requirement ;-).
